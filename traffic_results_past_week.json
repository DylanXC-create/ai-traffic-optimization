This could indicate:\n   - **Data Collection Error**: It's highly unlikely for three different intersections to have exactly the same delay metrics unless there's an error in data collection or entry.\n   - **Traffic Management**: If accurate, it suggests a pattern where traffic management strategies could be uniformly applied across these intersections.\n\n2. **Zero Delay Intersections**: Two intersections (Millersport Highway & Sheridan Drive, and Maple Road & North Forest Road) report zero delay:\n   - **Efficiency**: These intersections might be well-designed or managed with efficient traffic signals or natural traffic flow patterns that do not require additional optimization.\n   - **Verification Needed**: A zero delay might also suggest either under-reporting or that these locations are not capturing peak traffic times or volumes.\n\n### Recommendations for Traffic Optimization:\n\n1. **Data Accuracy Verification**:\n   - **Audit Data Collection**: Verify the methodology used for data collection at all intersections to ensure accuracy. If errors are found, recalibrate the data collection systems.\n\n2. **Traffic Signal Optimization**:\n   - **For High Delay Intersections**: \n     - Implement adaptive traffic signal control systems"

Consider using sensors or cameras to provide real-time traffic data rather than estimates or averages.\n\n2. **Peak Hour Analysis**:\n   - **Conduct Detailed Studies**: Even with zero reported delays, analyze"
