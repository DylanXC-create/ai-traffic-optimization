This could imply:\n   - **Efficient Traffic Management**: Current traffic light timings and road designs are effectively managing the flow of vehicles.\n   - **Data Accuracy**: The data might not fully reflect real traffic conditions, possibly due to how or when the data was collected (e.g., not capturing peak hours, weekends, or special events).\n\n2. **Uniform Traffic Volume**: All intersections report the same number of vehicles (5600), which is unusual and might indicate:\n   - **Data Entry Error**: If this number represents daily traffic, it's surprisingly consistent across different intersections, suggesting potential inaccuracies or normalization in data collection.\n   - **Seasonal or Non-Peak Data**: The data might be from a less busy period or averaged in a way that doesn't capture variability.\n\n### Recommendations for Traffic Optimization:\n\n1. **Data Verification and Collection**:\n   - **Improve Data Collection**: Implement or verify traffic data collection methods to ensure they capture peak times, special events, and variations throughout the day and week. Use cameras, sensors, or mobile app data to get a more dynamic view of traffic patterns.\n\n2. **Traffic Signal Optimization**:\n   - **Dynamic Signal Timing**: Even though no delays are currently reported, implementing adaptive traffic signal control"

This could be due to high traffic volume, suboptimal traffic light timing, or physical layout issues.\n\n   - **Ridge Road & Orchard Park Road** and **Union Road & Center Road** both show a delay of 0.13 minutes per vehicle, which is relatively minor but still suggests room for improvement.\n\n2. **Volume Consistency:** \n   - All intersections have an identical vehicle count of 5600, which might indicate a standardized count method or an average taken over a period rather than actual daily counts. This consistency suggests that traffic distribution might be relatively even across these routes, or the data might need normalization for more accurate analysis.\n\n3. **Economic Impact:**\n   - **Transit Road (NY-78) & Clinton Street** shows the highest economic impact due to delays with time savings potential of $196.79 and fuel savings"
