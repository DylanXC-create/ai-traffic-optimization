This intersection sees a considerable amount of traffic (5600 vehicles) which suggests high usage but also indicates potential inefficiency in traffic management or signal timing.\n\n2. **No Congestion**:\n   - Other intersections like Delaware Avenue & Niagara Square, Main Street & Bailey Avenue, Kensington Avenue & Harlem Road, and Jefferson Avenue & Best Street show zero delay, which might suggest:\n     - Efficient traffic light timings.\n     - Lower traffic volumes during peak times.\n     - Possible under-reporting or data collection issues.\n\n3. **Economic Impact**:\n   - At Elmwood & Hertel, there's a notable economic impact with $442.78 in time savings and $63.76 in fuel savings, indicating that improvements could yield financial benefits for commuters.\n\n### Recommendations for Traffic Optimization:\n\n#### **For Elmwood Avenue & Hertel Avenue:**\n\n- **Signal Timing Adjustment**: Review and possibly adjust the signal timings to reduce wait times.

This might be due to:\n   - Higher traffic volume during peak hours not reflected in the average delay.\n   - Inefficient signal timing or poor intersection design.\n\n2. **Zero Delay Intersections:** The absence of delay at the other intersections might indicate:\n   - Effective traffic management.\n   - Potentially low traffic volumes or times when data was collected not representing peak hours.\n   - Data collection issues or errors, as zero delay across multiple intersections seems unlikely in a real-world scenario.\n\n### Recommendations for Traffic Optimization:\n\n1. **Intersection Analysis at Walden Avenue & Central Avenue:**\n   - **Signal Timing Adjustment:** Analyze peak-hour traffic flow to adjust signal timings for better synchronization"

This could imply:\n     - The data might be normalized or rounded, not reflecting real-time variations.\n     - There's a possibility of consistent traffic distribution across these intersections.\n\n3. **No Savings in Time or Fuel**: \n   - With zero delay, there's also no reported savings in time or fuel, which is consistent with the absence of congestion.\n\n### Recommendations for Traffic Optimization:\n\n1. **Data Verification**:\n   - **Verify Data Collection**: Ensure that the traffic data is accurately reflecting real-world conditions. This might involve:\n     - Checking the functionality of sensors or cameras used for data collection.\n     - Reviewing the time frames during which data is collected to capture peak traffic conditions.\n\n2. **Dynamic Traffic Signal Management**:\n   - **Implement Adaptive Signal Control"
