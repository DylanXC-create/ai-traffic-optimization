This level of delay, while not severe, suggests room for improvement in traffic management.\n\n2. **Traffic Impact Analysis:**\n   - **Economic and Environmental Impact**: The intersections with delays show a modest economic impact with time savings calculated at around $136.24 to $204.36 per day, and fuel savings from $19.62 to $29.43. These savings, although small on a per-vehicle basis, accumulate over time and could represent significant savings annually.\n\n### Recommendations for Traffic Optimization:\n\n**1. Signal Timing Adjustments:**\n   - **Main Street & Eggert Road and Millersport Highway & Sheridan Drive**: Implement adaptive traffic signal control systems which can dynamically adjust signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions.

Here are some steps and recommendations to analyze and optimize traffic:\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Traffic Volume Consistency**: The data shows 4800 vehicles at each intersection, which might suggest either a standardized measure or an error in data aggregation. \n  - **Action**: Verify the accuracy of the traffic volume data. Ensure that the method of counting vehicles is consistent and accurate across all intersections.\n\n- **No Delay**: Zero delay could mean:\n  - The intersections are over-capacity in terms of handling traffic, or there might be another issue with how delays are measured or defined.\n  - **Action**: Implement a more granular data collection system that can capture peak hour delays or sporadic congestion events.\n\n### Recommendations for Traffic Optimization:\n\n1. **Data Validation**:\n   - **Audit Current Systems**: Review the current traffic monitoring systems for accuracy. Consider installing or upgrading to systems like cameras or sensors that can provide real-time traffic data.\n\n2. **Enhanced Traffic Monitoring**:\n   - **Real-Time Traffic Data**: Deploy real-time"
