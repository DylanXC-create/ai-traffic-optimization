With 7200 vehicles passing through, this represents significant congestion.\n   - **Millersport Highway (NY-263) & Sheridan Drive** - Similar to the above, with identical delay metrics, indicating another area of high congestion.\n\n2. **Low Congestion Points:**\n   - **Transit Road (NY-78) & Maple Road** and **Maple Road & North Forest Road** show zero delay, suggesting these intersections handle traffic very efficiently or are underutilized in terms of traffic volume.\n\n3. **Moderate Congestion:**\n   - **Main Street (NY-5) & Eggert Road** - A delay of 0.17 minutes per vehicle indicates some congestion, but it's relatively minor compared to other intersections.\n\n### Recommendations for Traffic Optimization:\n\n#### **1.

Signal Timing Adjustments:**\n   - **Genesee Street & Transit Road, Harlem Road & Walden Avenue, Union Road & George Urban Boulevard:** These intersections all have the same delay suggesting a possible need for signal retiming.

Real traffic usually shows variations in flow rates, especially at different times of the day.\n\n- **Potential for Hidden Issues**: While no delays are reported, this could also mean that there are no significant traffic events like accidents or construction, or that the traffic data collection system might not capture minor or sporadic delays.\n\n### Recommendations for Traffic Optimization:\n\n1. ****Verify Data Collection**:** Ensure the accuracy of traffic data collection.

This might suggest either a data entry error or that these intersections are very similar in their traffic management or volume.\n\n2. **Delay Analysis**:\n   - **High Delay Intersections**: All intersections except Seneca Street & Harlem Road have a delay of 0.95 minutes per vehicle. This indicates a consistent issue across multiple locations, potentially due to:\n     - Traffic signals not optimized for peak traffic flows.\n     - Insufficient turn lanes or merging lanes leading to backups.\n     - General high traffic volume during peak times.\n\n   - **Seneca Street & Harlem Road**: This intersection has a significantly lower delay (0.22 min/vehicle), suggesting better traffic flow management or less traffic volume.\n\n3. **Volume and Impact**:\n   - Each intersection sees 7,200 vehicles, indicating significant traffic flow. The uniform high number of vehicles across intersections implies these are major routes or thoroughfares.\n\n### Recommendations for Traffic Optimization:\n\n1. **Signal Timing Optimization**:\n   **-** Implement adaptive traffic signal control systems that adjust timings based on real-time traffic flow. This could reduce delay times significantly at the intersections with 0.9"
